# A Repository that documents my jouney towards learning d3.js for visualisation.

## Each lesson has it's own directory, and will add layers of complexity on top of previous lessons to create better visualisations.

## d3.js is being used with React for interactivity for now. The plan is to start using Svelte later on, and SvelteKit + AWS after, for full-stack apps.
